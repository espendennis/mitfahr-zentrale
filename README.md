# mitfahr-zentrale
This site was made with Spring-Boot, Spring-Security, Spring-Data, Apache Tiles and Bootstrap. It also features a REST-api. This side was only made to practice the used technologies. Therefore the design is pretty simple due to the focus on functionality.

If you want to try it, please start a new Spring-Boot project, use the DatabaseDump.sql to set up the database and update the settings in /Mitfahr-Zentrale/src/main/resources/config/application.properties according to your database settings.
